    Olav had to write the prelude himself for the master's entry, 
    so we've used those :)

    Generator functions:
        testSets [n] [prop_*]
        quickcheck [prop_*]
    
    where prop = prop_union, prop_intersect, prop_difference, prop_unionNrElements, 
                 prop_intersectNrElements, prop_differenceNrElements

    Both the quicktest and self written functions pass.

 Which makes sense. The symmetric closure of [(1,2),(3,3)] = [(1,2),(2,1),(3,3)], and the transitive closure of [(1,2),(2,1),(3,3)] = [(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(3,3)]

 While the transitive closure of [(1,2),(3,3)] = [(1,2),(3,3)], and the symmetric clusure of [(1,2),(3,3)] = [(1,2),(2,1),(3,3)]

 Thus (symClos.trClos) â‰  (trClos.symClos)
